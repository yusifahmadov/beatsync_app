Beat Sync is a mobile app that helps users improve their health and well-being by tracking their heart rate variability (HRV).

Pulse Insights will capture HRV data using the smartphone's camera, estimate HRV, and provide insights into stress, recovery, and overall well-being. The app will also track HRV trends over time, enabling users to discover patterns that can help them optimize their health.

Short description of the project:
Flutter - camera access, PPG signal capture, basic UI, data transfer.
Supabase -  API endpoints, signal processing, HRV calculation, database integration.
Integration - connecting frontend and backend, testing
Documentation -  preparing project documentation.
